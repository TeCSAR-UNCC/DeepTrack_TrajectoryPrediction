# DeepTrack: Lightweight Deep Learning for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in Highways
Welcome to the DeepTrack GitHub repository, a cutting-edge solution for vehicle trajectory prediction in the realm of intelligent transportation systems (ITS).  DeepTrack is a novel deep learning algorithm specifically tailored for real-time vehicle trajectory prediction. It uses Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)  to encode vehicle dynamics, ensuring high fidelity in time prediction and surpassing traditional methods. It also utilizes Depthwise Convolution that reduces model size and computational complexity, making DeepTrack lightweight yet powerful.

Despite its compact design, DeepTrack delivers accuracy levels that rival leading trajectory prediction models.  With its reduced computational demands, DeepTrack is ideal for deployment on IoT devices in dynamic traffic scenarios.
